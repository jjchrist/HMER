# Handwritten math expression recognition using CNN;
#
###### Handwritten math symbols dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols) reduced to 70 classes and approximately 500 images per class
### Language: Python (.py, .ipynb)
#### CNN built in Tensorflow
* **img_preprocess.py** - to precosess image before recognition,
* **main.py** - main file to start project with simple GUI
* **predict_fnc.py** - file with prediction functions
* **regexpr.py** - regular expression functions to prepare recognized expression before converting to LaTeX format
* **train.ipynb** - notebook with a model training, trained models are saved in 'model' directory
